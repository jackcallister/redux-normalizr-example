# Redux Normalizr Example

Readme is on the way!

## Tools

This example utilises the following setup

- Webpack/Babel/ES6
- React 0.14
- React DOM 0.14
- Redux 1.0
- All the new stuff 0.1.alpha-rc-beta-gamma@es6

## How it works

Start with [webUtils](https://github.com/jarsbe/redux-normalizr-example/blob/master/src/shared/webUtils/webUtils.js). A response with a nested object is returned. The normalized version returns a flat structure with ids as keys (very handy!), put a debugger in the reducer, right [here](https://github.com/jarsbe/redux-normalizr-example/blob/master/src/shared/reducers/meals.js#L10) and you'll get a clear idea.
